So basically, you are going to push a message with body all the times. It\u0027s not better to wait n seconds so it can be replaced and show the entired notification without spamming the system?\n\nwith that it all is ok, when a mail was received, it wait 2 seconds to display the notification and if in that time the body is complete then push the whole message after 4 seconds of receiving the message, and with all its content with only one notification. Isn\u0027t that better that publish a uncomplete message, and then refresh the notification with the body?",
