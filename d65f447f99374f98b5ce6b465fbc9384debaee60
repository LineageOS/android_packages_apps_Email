      "message": "Why not just send only this msg as delayed ^^^? Original all the message were delayed (if i read it correctly). So basically, you are going to push a message with body all the times. It\u0027s not better to wait n seconds so it can be replaced and show the entired notification without spamming the system?\n\nwith that it all is ok, when a mail was received, it wait 2 seconds to display the notification and if in that time the body is complete then push the whole message after 4 seconds of receiving the message, and with all its content with only one notification. Isn\u0027t that better that publish a uncomplete message, and then refresh the notification with the body?",

I think it\u0027s better to notify immediately and add missing content later than delaying the notification completely, especially as the old code did the same thing (see my comment in the old code)",
