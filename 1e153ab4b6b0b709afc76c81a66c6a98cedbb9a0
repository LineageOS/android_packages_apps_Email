      "message": "I\u0027ve tried the usual cases (reboot, kill app, kill and restart connectivity) and all of them worked. My assumption was that if the sync adapter service is started, a sync is imminent, which in turn will start the idle connection. My debug output seems to agree with that (IDLE was established just to be killed moments later), but I might be missing something. If you remember the cases this was designed for, please let me know :)",
