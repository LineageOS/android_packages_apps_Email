The onConnectivityRestored() callback happens on boot and/or app restart as well, so currently the IDLE connection is started twice (by the sync service and the connectivity restore). In case connectvity was lost before, we already tore down the IDLE connections anyway.\n\n(BTW, I think we can get away without explicitly starting the sync adapter service because of this)",
